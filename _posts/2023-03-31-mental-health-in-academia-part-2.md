> **Objectives:**
* To learn and practice concrete skills for **supporting peers**, like validation
* To **debunk** misconceptions about the jobs post-Ph.D.
{: .prompt-info }


## Pre-class work:
* Mental health in academia (part 2)
  * Read: [Validation in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)](https://frtc.ltd/blog/dbt-validation).
  * Provide an example of an invalidating conversation/experience you have had so far in your Ph.D. (or in your life). What made it invalidating? How could that conversation have been more validating?
  * Provide an example of a validating conversation/experience you have had so far in your Ph.D. (or in your life). What made it validating? 
  * Why are we asking you to learn about validation? What about this technique from DBT is important in a research community?
* Life after the Ph.D.
  * Have you thought at all about what you might want to do after the Ph.D (no worries if not – you have a lot of time)? If so, what are you thinking about? 
  * Read: [The Jobs I Didn't See: My Misconceptions of the Academic Job Market by Evan Peck](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422). Following the same analysis in the article, what would make you happy in the next stage of life / what are you looking to prioritize?
  * Read: [Most Ph.D.s aren't professors. Everything one can do other than be... by Amy J. Ko](https://medium.com/bits-and-behavior/most-ph-d-s-arent-professors-13a741ef6868). Are there any jobs on this list you've not considered before? If so, why do you think that is? 



## In class: [[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MduwEVqMNu4_B6cbwZxf1UdUItx6W1fz1F59XOclxII/edit?usp=sharing)]
* [10min] Socialize
* [10min] As a group, what did folks take away from last class's pre-class work about depression and anxiety?
* [60min] Present the concept of validation, present students with scenarios to respond to in groups. As a class, deconstruct students responses by carefully examining what the language implies to the listener, and whether it will have unintended (invalidating) consequences.
* [35min] Life after the Ph.D: What things might you look for in a job? Discussion of academia vs. industry, different types of academia, types of jobs students may not have thought about before, etc.
* [5min] In-class survey: what did students take away from today's class?


## Example Scenarios

* Your Ph.D. peer has been working on a problem set (that you already finished) and has been struggling to finish it. They've compromised their sleep, research, work/life balance in order to try to finish it. 
* You're working with a junior student. They came back last week with a ton of plots, none of which make sense to you, and upon some discussion, you realize these plots are not relevant to the project / aren't what you agreed on last time.
* Your friend who is graduating has multiple job offers at all the places you want to get a job. Instead of being happy, they seem really stressed out and upset that they have to make a decision.

## Tips

* Before responding, **pause and think**: what does your choice of words imply about the listener?
* Ask **open-ended** questions
* **Summarize** what was said, **repeat** it back, and **ask** if that was correct?
* **"Read minds"** – see if you can "guess" how they feel, and ask if they agree/disagree?
* Practice **non-judgemental** body language
* **Replace** words such as "but" and "however" with "and", and "in addition"
* Do not offer **advice**, unless you're asked to, or unless you explicitly checked that this is what they want
