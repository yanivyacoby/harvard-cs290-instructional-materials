> **Objectives:**
* **Normalize struggle** inherent in developing literature skills, especially around tasks the seem trivially easy but are in fact difficult (like googling the correct keywords)
* Promote a **growth-mindset**: this is a skill that is **learned**, not inborn.
* Teach students how to **break-down** the literature search into **smaller, simpler task** -- see guide on [how to conduct a literature search](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-do-a-literature-search).
{: .prompt-info }


## Pre-class work
* Read Et al. for all: [Citations as a Tool for Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Justice](https://rurisi.com/citation-guide), and answer:
  * What are the negative effects of citation bias?
  * What can we do to adopt more conscientious citation practices?
* What do you find to be the most challenging aspect of doing a literature search? 
* Describe your current strategy for doing a literature search for each of the following components: finding papers, reading papers, and tracking papers.


## In class \[[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i6_H-NZ3pDQdovg_cvTt4eS_xogvwCEV7yCilD92nxM/edit#slide=id.p)\]
> This unit generally follows the structure of our guide on [how to conduct a literature search](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-do-a-literature-search).
{: .prompt-tip }
1. [15min] Students introduce themselves with the slides they made
2. [15min] Introduction: recap of last class, group discussion of reading about citation biases
  * What were everyone's takeaways from last class about how to skim a paper?
  * Has anyone tried this strategy over the last week? How did it go?
  * What are some takeaways from the pre-class work about citation biases?
    > **Insight:** (a) Citations are often used as a measure of success, problematically leading to inequities. (b) More broadly, everything we do as researchers leaves a fingerprint -- who we collaborate with, who we cite, etc.

3. [5min] Overview: how to do a literature search?
  * What is a literature search? What is it for? Why is it hard?
  * Present a step-by-step guide on [how to conduct a literature search](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-do-a-literature-search)
3. [10min] Small group activity #1: find the relevant keywords for a given research prompt (see example below)
4. [10min] Regroup: what were the keywords found? How did you know they were relevant? what was hard about this? (probably: knowing which keywords to search for, verifying a paper is relevant)
5. [5min] Presenting a guide to conduct a literature search
6. [20min] Small-group activity #2: given a research prompt and a list of papers: which are relevant? and in what ways are they relevant (i.e. which category do they belong to)? (see example below)
7. [15min] Regroup: go over list of papers and discuss
8. [5min] In-class survey
  * Describe a new strategy you learned (if any) for doing a literature search for each of the following components: finding papers, reading papers, and tracking papers.
  * Is there anything else you took away? If so, what is it?


## Example Exercise

Given the research problem below (purposefully selected to be in a CS-adjacent field -- statistical genetics -- so that no student has prior knowledge):
1. Search for relevant **keywords** online. What are they? How did you know if they are **relevant**?
2. Given the list of papers below, which are **relevant**? In what way(s) are they relevant/irrelevant to the problem statement?

**Problem:** There is significant bias in the data collection used Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) towards populations that identify as of European ancestry. As a result, statistical models of the data are substantially less predictive for populations identifying as of non-European ancestry.

**Significance:** Increased health disparities between populations identifying as of European vs. non-European ancestry.

**Goal:** To develop statistical methodology capable of both using existing data and effectively leveraging data from a more inclusive collection process to generalize well to populations identifying as of non-European ancestry.

**List of papers:**
* TODO.
