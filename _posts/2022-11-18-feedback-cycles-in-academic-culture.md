> **Objectives:**
* Introduce concept of **systemic** issue, as an issue stemming from economic, cultural, legal, etc. structures and incentives.
* Re-motivate the purpose of the seminar so far as a systemic **intervention** to the problem of **hidden curriculum** in doctoral programs.
* Demonstrate to students how positive feedback cycles in academic **reinforce** problematic misconceptions. This ultimately impedes us as a community from performing rigorous, inclusive and useful science, as well as individually in our professional growth, by contributing to unrealistic self-expectations (and therefore poor mental health), hindering from building supportive academic communities.
* Brainstorm **interventions** to break such cycles

## Pre-class work

1. Watch [The Pursuit of Collective Intelligence](https://cornell.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=01d4c974-d005-434a-8544-a8cf0179150f) by Professor Radhika Nagpal. We encourage you all to watch this talk in groups! Answer:
  * What are the "rules" of academic culture mentioned in the talk? What are the criticism of these rules? 
  * Are there any other such "rules" you've observed or experienced in your Ph.D. experience so far? 
  * What else did you take away from the talk?

> **Tip:** We have also found that this class material (and the below exercise) can be effectively repurposed as a standalone-workshop for cohort building to encourage explicit discussion of shared struggles.

1. [10min] Socialize
2. [20min] Discussion of "The Pursuit of Collective Intelligence":
  * How does the speaker define collective intelligence?
  * Ideally, what are the goals of the scientific community?
  * According to the speaker, what are some bad rules and good rules that we currently operate under to achieve the goals of our scientific community?
  * In groups: can you think of bad rules and good rules that we currently or could operate under to achieve the goals of our scientific community?
3. [10min] Re-motivate the seminar (what we've covered so far) as an intervention to a systemic issue -- hidden curricula in doctoral programs. Use this as a platform to talk about the broader issue: positive feedback cycles that reinforce problematic academic cultural values.
4. Remainder of class: each group gets assigned one section on the [course materials](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/) page. From the paragraph in that section, and from skimming the abstracts of the papers, students will construct their own feedback cycles following the template below.
5. Re-group to discuss the students' responses
6. Ask students to fill in-class survey:
  * TODO


## Understanding Feedback Cycles in Academic Culture


**Instructions:**
Go to the materials page of the course website. Read your assigned section. You may find it helpful to quickly skim through abstracts / titles of the listed papers.
Create a positive feedback cycle following the below template.
Please pay particular attention to the way the cycle reinforces societal misconceptions.
