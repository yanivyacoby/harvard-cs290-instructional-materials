> **Objectives:**
* To understand and be able analyze the barriers in **equitable and fair** participation (from the previous session) using a number of **theoretical frameworks** in EDIB: e.g., **intersectionality, the matrix of domination**. 
* To leverage these frameworks to design potential interventions for **dismantling barriers**.

* Answer:
  * Recall that in class we defined four categories of barriers to participation:
    * Microaggressions: (a) gate-keeping (b) stereotype threat/lift  
    * Invisible labor  
    * Privilege hazard  
    * Visible vs. invisible axes of marginalization
  * For each of the short "horror" stories, identify two examples of the barriers we discussed.
  * The matrix of domination helps us analyze an outcome we might see in society given (correlated) macro and micro factors. Given the short "horror" stories, identify the four domains that contribute to these common experiences in math: 
    * Structural: What are the systems and rules in academia?
    * Disciplinary: How are these rules enforced? 
    * Hegemonic: What are the cultural/media tropes or perceptions of math/academia?
    * Interpersonal: What are the important interpersonal relationships in academia? 
  * Can you describe how these four domains affect each other?


## In class \[[slides](assets/DEI-part2.pdf)\]
1. We review the four types of barriers in equitable and fair participation. We identify examples of these barriers in the personal narrative readings.
2. We learn about four theoretical perspectives for understanding these participatory barriers.
3. We practice analyzing everyday experiences using these theoretical frameworks as a class. 
4. We practice designing potential interventions to mitigate participatory barriers
5. Complete in-class survey: What did you take away from todayâ€™s class?
