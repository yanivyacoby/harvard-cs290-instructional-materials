> **Objectives:**
* To **lower barriers** for help seeking by ensuring students know the course staff, their advisor(s) and senior researchers in their labs to ensure they feel comfortable enough reaching out when they need help.

## Attend a course staff office hours

You're required to attend the office hours of one member of the course staff at least once throughout the semester. 
The purpose of these meetings is for us to get to know all of you. 
As such, you don't need to have a specific question in mind (but if you do, that's always welcome). 
If you can't make any of the office hours, please reach out to one of us to schedule a time!


## Solicit feedback from your advisor(s)

Learning how to **evaluate** your progress in the Ph.D. is a **crucial component** of your development as a researcher. 
Like many of the other skills we've discussed so far in the class 
(e.g. reading research papers, doing a literature search, soliciting research feedback from your collaborators, etc.), 
this is a skill that is **learned** through **deliberate practice**. 

In this assignment, we provide you with a template to use in soliciting feedback from your advisor. 
We ask you that you share this document with them **ahead of time**, and then meet with them 1-on-1 to fill it out **together**. 
We encourage you to solicit feedback in a format similar to this every couple of weeks so you can ensure you're putting your efforts where they **matter most**.
Note that not all of the below items are relevant to you, so please answer as appropriate.

Before you begin your evaluation, we would like to **dispel** a few **myths** you may have:
1. It is as much your advisors' responsibility to provide you feedback as it is your responsibility to solicit feedback. As such, it is important you get in the **habit** of **explicitly** soliciting for the feedback you need to improve. This is also your chance to learn how your advisor(s) see Ph.D. student development.
2. If your advisor(s) bring(s) up areas of growth, **it does NOT mean you're doing poorly**. You're in the beginning of your Ph.D. journey, so it is expected you have a lot to learn.
3. **Do not push this off** until you feel certain your advisor(s) is/are happy with your progress. Many of us students have tendencies to “read tea leaves” (i.e. guess from facial expressions, messages, etc.) when trying to determine if our advisor(s) are happy with us, instead of asking explicitly. You may find that even at times you aren't certain your advisor(s) is/are happy with you, they actually are. 

** Instructions:** For each of the categories below, ask your advisor:
1. What are my strengths?
2. What are my areas of growth?

Since you're a Ph.D. student just starting on their journey, there may be many areas of growth for you. 
This is, again, not an issue, but a natural product of where you are in the process. 
It is helpful, however, to agree with your advisor(s) on which of the above areas of growth are the highest priority for the next few weeks. 
This will help ensure you’re not spreading yourself too thin. 
As such, after discussing your strengths and areas of growth in every category below, ask your advisor(s) the following questions:
1. Which of the areas of growth above should I focus on most in the next few weeks?
2. What are concrete ways to improve in the above areas of growth?
3. hen would it be helpful to check in again and re-evaluate how I'm doing?

Lastly, don’t forget to thank your advisor(s) for their feedback and investment in your growth!
