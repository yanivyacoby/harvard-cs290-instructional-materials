> **Objectives:**
* **Clarify** how advisors think of Ph.D. student development -- what do they **value** in the early years of the Ph.D?
* **Humanize** the advisor's perspective through discussion of imposter phenomenon of faculty
* Make **explicit** the non-linear "failure"-filled path faculty took to success. 
{: .prompt-info }


## Pre-class work
1. Review Section 2 of [How to make the most of your PhD](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/a-guide-to-your-phd/guide.html). Answer: 
  * Are there any expectations that your advisor has communicated to you that aren't on this list? 
  * What is one advisor expectation that you've improved on so far? What strategy helped you meet this expectation? 
  * What is one advisor expectation that you want to improve in? What is your current strategy for this expectation? 
2. Read [What triggers imposter phenomenon among academic faculty? A critical incident study exploring antecedents, coping, and development opportunities](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Holly-Hutchins/publication/309657285_What_triggers_imposter_phenomenon_among_academic_faculty_A_critical_incident_study_exploring_antecedents_coping_and_development_opportunities/links/59f769960f7e9b553ebee2a5/What-triggers-imposter-phenomenon-among-academic-faculty-A-critical-incident-study-exploring-antecedents-coping-and-development-opportunities.pdf)
  * On page 3, the authors state: "Rather than exploring imposter phenomenon as an experience to be avoided, we posit it as a formative part of career learning and development that shapes how faculty develop their professional identity." Do you agree or disagree with this statement, and why? 
  * According to the findings, what is at least one way in which imposter phenomenon is experienced differently (e.g. triggered, perceived, coped with) among faculty with different identities? 
3. What questions would you like to ask the faculty? (theme: their experience as Ph.D. students, their experience as faculty, their expectations of their Ph.D. students).
