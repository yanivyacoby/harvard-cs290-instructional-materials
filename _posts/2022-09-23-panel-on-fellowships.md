> **Objectives:**
* Debunk **misconceptions** about professional writing
* Teach students about fellowship opportunities and what they are for
* Debunk **misconceptions** about fellowships: for example:
  * That it's important to get a fellowship to succeed
  * That the goal of applying to fellowships is to get a fellowship (e.g. a more productive goal is to apply for the experience/practice of writing a research proposal)

## Pre-class work
1. Peruse information about fellowships (see course website). Think of questions to ask the panel. Submit one of these questions.
  * Skim the fellowship advice from [Harvard](https://gsas.harvard.edu/financial-support/fellowships) and by [MIT](https://oge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/fellowship-tips/) (click on left-pane links).
  * Peruse the list of fellowships compiled by [John Girash](https://wiki.harvard.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SEASDOCSOAP&title=List+of+external+fellowships), by [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gradfellowships/), and by [NC State](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/dgp/fellowships.html).
2. Watch [Larry McEnerney: The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM). We encourage you to watch this talk in groups! Answer:
  * According to the lecture, what is the writing process useful for? Hint: what are the "horizontal" vs. "vertical" axes? Explain.
  * In what ways does writing differ between high-school/undergraduate and doctoral programs? What are the implications of these differences? (list at least 2). Hint #1: where does "value" lie. Hint #2: what are "explanations" for?
  * What is the goal of professional writing?
  * What's the "positivistic" model of knowledge vs. the second model he introduces? What's the significance of this distinction? 
  * Why is it important to know the "codes" of your community?
  * What does the lecturer mean by "instability" vs. "stability"? 


## In class
1. [10min] Get food, sit next to folks you haven't met and introduce yourself using your slide
2. Recap: how do you you do a lit search for whether a paper is relevant or not if you are confused about your problem? 
3. [30min] Small-group reflection on "The craft of writing effectively". Determine questions based on their pre-class work responses. Ideas include:
  * According to the lecture, are "knowledge" and "value" objective or subjective? What are the ethical implication of this?
  * Was there anything that surprised you? Was there anything that you disagreed with?
  * Why is professional writing hard?
4. [5min] Re-group
5. Panel for the rest of class, balancing previously submitted questions, questions from the bank below, and questions from students in class.
6. [5min] In-class survey
  * What did you take away from class today?
