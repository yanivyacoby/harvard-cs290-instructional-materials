> **Objectives:**
* Demonstrate to the students (by example) that it is **normal** to experience challenges in the PhD, and that it's a good idea to talk about these challenges with their peers.
* Help students distinguish between "good" challenges and "unhelpful" challenges through the lens of self-expectations.
* Introduce the term **hidden curriculum** to describe the implicit expectations surrounding how docotral students should think, talk, look like, and what they should value. Connect this to previous soft skill building (i.e. soft skills are an important component of the hidden curriculum of the Ph.D.).
* Introduce a model for Ph.D. student development and emphasize that expectations are a function of each students' **stage** in the program.

## Pre-class work
1. Read [How to make the most of your PhD](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/a-guide-to-your-phd/guide.html). Answer: 
  * Is there anything that you've found expecting from yourself in your first year that wasn't on this list?
  * Has this expectation positively or negatively impacted your PhD experience so far? 
  * What are concrete ways in which you plan to support your peers through the end of the semester?
  * Is there anything you took away from this guide?
2. Read: "Graduate Student Adjustment to Academic Life A Four-Stage Framework" (Note: the words competent/incompetent in the article are technical jargon from the learning and cognition literature. As such, you should not interpret them using their colloquial meanings; we instead encourage you to think of these terms more as novice/expert).
  * What is Beeler's four stage framework?
  * According to this model, what stage are you in?
  * Do you find this model useful in thinking about your own current/future Ph.D. experience? Why or why not?
3. Submit at least one question for this week's panel on debugging unhealthy self-expectations.

> **Note:** Only students are present during this class to create a safe space for students to ask questions about difficult topics.

1. [10min] Socialize
2. [30min] Small-group discussion and recap about:
  * What did you think of [How to make the most out of your PhD](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/a-guide-to-your-phd/guide.html)? What are some actionabl takeaways? How can you support your peers?
  * What did you think of Beeler's model? Which stage are you in? What did you find valuable about it? And what did you criticize about it?
3. [5min] Share what we find useful about Beeler's model:
  * That many Ph.D. students in fact feel it is generally reflective of their development as researcher throughout the whole Ph.D. (as opposed to just the first year)
  * That it can help show us what we need / what to prioritize in each stage
  * That it can ultimately help us become better mentors in the future
4. Remainder of class: panel with senior Ph.D. students about debugging unhealthy self-expectations.
  * Normalize common struggles throughout the Ph.D. by asking panelists to agree/disagree with statements by raising their hands (see below).
  > **Insight:** What we portray is oftentimes not reflective of what we actually feel.
  * Lead panel discussion.
5. Ask students to fill in-class survey:
  * TODO


## Example Statements for Panelists

In class, we ask the panelists to raise their hands if they relate to statements describing common (but seldom discussed) challenges of the Ph.D.
We find this allows panelists to lead by example and create a safe space for students to ask difficult questions that are on their mind.

> **Note:** Not all panelists will be comfortable being so open about their experience. As such, it is vital to check with them a priori. It is especially important to take care asking panelists from minoritized backgrounds and identities to comment on statements that align with negative societal stereotypes. We found it helpful to have a meeting with the panelists prior to the session and lead an open discussion to best understand everyone's boundaries. 
{: .prompt-danger }

> **Note:** We did find that leading such discussions was not only helpful for students, but also for the panelists. Oftentimes, junior panelists asked for advice from senior panelists, and all panelists expressed a sense of validation from having such an open discussion about shared struggles. 
{: .prompt-tip }

Example statements include:

* "Everything takes too long! Even reading a research paper takes hours and hours"
* "I'm only taking like two classes, why do I not have time for anything else?"
* "All of my labmates/peers are so successful and efficient. They always say smart things and seem to be balanced -- why am I not..."
* "How do I pick a project that is both realistic enough to accomplish but also not trivial?"
* "It seems like to be accepted / successful here, I need to walk, talk, think differently in ways that fundamentally change who I am"
* "How am I ever supposed to go from what I'm doing now to a fully finished research paper?"
* "I sometimes/often think about quitting the Ph.D."
* "I'm not sure what my advisor expects of me"
* "I had a bad meeting with my advisor and now they know they made a mistake admitting me"
* "I feel like I'm doing worse than everyone around me"
* "When I was an undergrad I aced >= 4 classes per semester. Now I'm struggling with 2-3. what's wrong with me?"
* "I feel like I can handle this workload if I just get organized and work harder. I feel lazy and guilty because I can't seem to motivate myself to get it together."
* "The undergrads in my class seem to be excelling and having an easy time with the materials. Why am I, as a grad student, struggling?"
* "I get a lot of anxiety looking at my email inbox/to-do list because I feel overwhelmed and I keep expecting people to realize that I don't really belong here."
* "I'm struggling to balance good grades, research, fellowship/internship search, etc. I feel extremely stressed, but my friends/family don't understand why. To them, I've already "made it" and no longer need to work so hard. Maybe the struggle is just in my head and I need to get over it."
* "I feel like my friends say that the classes are hard but everyone seems to be handling it just fine. It must just be me who is REALLY struggling."
* "I see my peers doing a ton of internship interviews/social activities/professional development, whereas I'm just barely making pset deadlines. Should I be doing more? If so, how?"
* "I feel like I don't have the right background to succeed â€“ I haven't been coding since high school / I didn't do my undergrad in math/CS."




## Question Bank TODO
* Raise your hand question
  * Raise your hand if there has been a time in your PhD in which you felt like you were doing worse than everyone else around you?
* Detecting and addressing unhealthy expectations
  *  What is an effective way to erase a bad habit of a negative self-expectation. And how do we detect one?
  *  
* First year:
  * For many, the first year of the PhD feels slow -- it feels like you work hard, and relative to more experienced PhD students, not too much comes out. Raise your hand if you feel like you've had that experience.
  * Is there a particular situation in which you felt this most strongly? How did you overcome this?
* Work/life balance:
  * For us to be productive and happy, it's important to have work/life balance. How do you maintaining this balance over the PhD so far?
* Imposter phenomenon:
  * Is there a specific situation you can share in which you felt this particularly strongly? How did you overcome it? 
* Skills:
  * In what ways have you improved during the PhD? How have you changed?
* Identity:
  * Difficult experiences are often difficult because they challenge our identities / how we think of ourselves. Raise your hand if you feel like you've had such an experience during the PhD?
  * What was the experience? How did you reconcile your old and new identities? 
* Community:
  * What is your community? How did you find it? What role does it have in your PhD experience?
* Positive outlook:
  * What's made grad school worth it for you?
