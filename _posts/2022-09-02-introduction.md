> **Objectives:**
* **Introduce** students to each other and to the course staff
* **Normalize** common worries
* Relate **common worries** to unhealthy self-expectations stemming from **misconceptions** about thep program
* Motivate course: that research requires learning a **hidden curriculum** of **soft-skills** (like reading papers, managing collaborations, etc.) that are seldom discussed explicitly in Ph.D. programs -- this course will make this hidden curriculum explicit
* Build a constructive definition of **research**

## Pre-class work
1. **Read [The Fear of Publicly Not Knowing](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-fear-of-publicly-not-knowing-239e1b7a39f3). Answer:**
  * What's the "fake it 'till you make it" approach?
  * How does the article criticize this approach?
  * Who, in our society, gets the "benefit of the doubt"?
  * What can you do to create a classroom community in which is it ok to not know?
2. **Read [What you should know about us (the instructors)](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/what-you-should-know-about-us). Answer:**
  * What do we (the course staff) expect of you in this seminar? 
3. **Create a slide to introduce yourself (in a shared slide-deck), including the following:**
  * Name + pronouns
  * One thing you can't tell by just looking at me is: _____.
  * This is important for me to tell you because: _____.
  * A picture of you
4. **Answer a demographic survey, consisting of the following questions:**
  * Name, pronouns
  * Dietary restrictions
  * Is there anything that would be helpful for the course staff to know about you?
  * Area (e.g. CS, AM, etc.) and subfield (e.g. ML, Theory, Systems, etc.)
  * Who is/are your advisor(s)?
  * What did you study in undergrad/master's?
  * What are you hoping to get out of your Ph.D. professionally?
  * What are you hoping to get out of your Ph.D. personally?
  * Is there anything you're worried about/intimidated by?


## In class: \[[slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Mal6OeGr5pl60iXjVjWIwG764Bn2E2JFxKAui0E4xFo/edit?usp=sharing)\]
1. [20min] Students get food, sit down (4-5 students per table), write name tags, and introduce themselves to each other using the slides they created.
2. [3min] Course staff introduces themselves (using the slides)
3. [7min] Introduction
  * Course overview: roadmap of the course, course policies and grading
  * Present themes from the pre-class survey's question about worries.
  > **Insight:** Most students, while coming from diverse backgrounds, share similar worries about the program.
  {: .prompt-tip }
4. [Discussion + regroup] Break into small groups for discussion of the following questions:
  * [15min + 5min] Q1: What's the expectation/assumption implied by the statement/worry? (see below for an example)
    > **Insight:** Most of these worries stem from misconceptions about the Ph.D. program, leading to unhealthy self-expectations.
  {: .prompt-tip }
  * [10min + 5min] Q2: What is research?
  * [10min + 5min] Q3: What skills do you need to do research? (When re-grouping, relate this back to the course overview).
  > **Insight:** Our definition of research, as well as most of the skills mentioned in the groups, do not accurately reflect many of the most important skills to develop during the Ph.D. (see slides for an example list). This course will focus on exactly these skills. 
  {: .prompt-tip }
  
5. [5min] A brief guide to classes and program requirements (covered in the orientation but promptly forgotten by students): for example,
  * Show the 5-year SEAS course plan
  * Introduce the Q-guide
  * Recommend students take <= 2 technical classes + CS290 in their first semester (unless they were told otherwise by their advisor(s))	
  * Encourage students to go for a B average, and tell them it's ok to get B- (unless they are applying to fellowships or told otherwise by their advisor(s))
  * Emphasize that classes are a "team sport" (collaborate and go to office hours)
6. [3min] Ask students to answer in-class survey:
  * What's one thing you took away from today's class?
7. [17min] Informal Q/A with current invited second-year students and course staff


## Example in-class student responses from Fall 2022

In the pre-class work for the first class, there were many themes that popped up over and over again -- worries that seemed to be on everyone's mind. It's important for us to come together as a community to discuss what are the expectations/assumption implied by each of these worries so that we can set more realistic expectations for ourselves, support each other, and ultimately enjoy the Ph.D. Below are the statements (worries), as well as the expectations implied by the statements you all came up with in class:


<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Statement</th>
    <th>Expectation/assumption behind statement</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><i>My peers are more accomplished than me</i></td>
    <td>
	Assumes that you need to have similar accomplishments as all other students combined<br>
    	Assumes that past success indicates future success<br>
	Assumes that everyone values the same type of achievements<br>
	Assumes that everybody is at the same point in their academic journey<br>
	Assumes that you are in a competition with your peers, rather than cooperate with and seek help from them.<br>
	It is often assumed you need publications to get accepted to PhD programs</td>
