{: .prompt-info }


## Pre-class work:

Revise the slides you made for the [first class]({{ site.baseurl }}/posts/introduction/#pre-class-work) to include a sentence about:
1. Something you learned about yourself over the past year, and
2. A direction youâ€™re excited to grow in for the next year.


## In class:

* [10min] Socialize
* [45min] Every student re-introduces themselves and shares their answer to the pre-class work
* [30min] In small groups as students to reflect on:
  * What was helpful for them in their first-year, and what would have made their first year better?
  * How can they support the next generation of incoming students in their lab?
* [5min] Give students tips for the upcoming year: e.g.,
  * TF-ing: Ask yourself, what are you hoping to get out of the experience? TF for someone who is organized and cares about your growth.
  * Qualifying exam: Every lab is different, so ask your advisor(s) what they expect, as well as more senior folks in your lab. Be sure to give a practice qual talk!
  * Courses: You have an elective + external minor: you can be creative with what counts for this! 
  * Summer: Don't take all the time you spent on research and pour it into research -- take some time for other things!
* [30min] Ask students to fill an evaluation survey
