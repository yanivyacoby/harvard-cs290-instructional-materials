> **Objectives:**
* **Normalize struggle** inherent in developing effective communication skills
* Promote a **growth-mindset**: this is a skill that is **learned**, not inborn.
* Debunk **misconceptions** about what constitute "good" communication practices. 
* Teach students how to **break-down** the verbal communication into a **step-by-step** process -- see guide on [how to communicate about weekly progress with your collaborators](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/communication-in-collaborative-environments).

## Pre-class work
1. In this class we will discuss and practice how to update your advisor / collaborators on recent progress. Please come to class with a topic in mind -- a project (e.g. current or past research project, a hobby, etc.) that you have worked on but haven't yet completed. The topic should be reasonably technical (your fellow classmates should only have a partial prior understanding of the topic). Describe it.
2. What do you find difficult about updating your advisor(s) / collaborator(s) about recent research progress you made?
3. What is the general format/strategy you use when updating your advisor(s)/collaborator(s) about recent research progress you made?

{: .prompt-tip }
1. [10min] Students socialize
2. [10min] Recap on panels: what did everyone take away from the class on panels?
3. [10min] Debunk myths about how your collaborators understand your update (see guide). TA gives an example of an unclear update and asks class what went wrong. 
4. [10min] Our strategy for giving a good update + class TA gives an example of a good update (see slides)
5. [20min] Pair-exercise #1:
  * Pair up with someone in a different field who is not familiar your project
  * Describe the project (using the template)
  * Switch (5min for presenting, 3min for feedback)
6. [10min] Regroup: for example,
  * What was difficult about the exercise?
  * Which steps in the guide helped you best understand your peer's project?
7. [15min] Pair-exercise #2: pick a different pair, repeat but with (2min, ~3min for feedback)
8. [5min] Regroup
9. [5min] In-class survey:
  * What are ways (if any) your strategies for giving research updates has changed?
  * Is there anything else you took away from class?
