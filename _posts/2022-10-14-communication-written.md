> **Objectives:**
* **Normalize struggle** inherent in developing effective communication skills
* Promote a **growth-mindset**: this is a skill that is **learned**, not inborn.
* Debunk **misconceptions** about what constitute "good" communication practices. 
* Teach students how to **break-down** written communication into a **step-by-step** process -- see guide on [how to communicate about weekly progress with your collaborators](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/communication-in-collaborative-environments).

## Pre-class work
* Follow [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/63375e1f74f7768cc519b521) in preparing a written "research report", following the structure discussed in our [guide about communicating with collaborators](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/communication-in-collaborative-environments).
* TODO?

## In class 
1. [10min] Students socialize
2. [10min] Recap of takeaways from "how to read a theory paper", and discussion about what folks find challenging about writing reports
4. Students swap reports and give each other feedback
5. Re-group: what did you learn?
6. Since at this point in the semester, students are tired: lead small group-discussion on how things were going, what folks found surprising so far about their experience, how have their identities been challenged, etc.
