## Pre-class work
* Use this week to reflect and identify a least one way that your current self-organization system is successful and one way that it can be further developed. Both will be helpful as we identify strategies during the workshop. 
* What is one thing you are worried about this semester (if any)? 
* What is one thing you are looking forward to this semester (if any)? 

## In class \[slides: [part 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12c841Eh43RK4a2kr6MLjEwfHv6GMI47ixQJkIvF9HRE/edit?usp=share_link), part 2 (unavailable)\]
1. [10min] Students socialize
2. [20min] Overview of the spring semester:
  * Recap "cycle of isolation" from the last class of the fall.
  * Explain how the fall was focused on factors impeding *individual* student growth. In contrast, in the spring we will shift the perspective to the broader context; specifically, we'll focus on the way these factors actually create an unsupportive and exclusionary *academic culture*.
  * Moreover, emphasize how in the spring, we'll be thinking of ways to create a more supportive and inclusive culture.
  * Lastly, summarize in what ways the course changed from their fall semester feedback.
3. Session by Harvard's [Academic Resource Center](https://academicresourcecenter.harvard.edu/) about self-organization and time-management -- please contact them for the materials used in their session.
4. [5min] In-class survey: What did you take away from class today?
