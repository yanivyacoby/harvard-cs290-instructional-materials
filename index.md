title: The 2022-2023 Teaching Materials for CS290
---


This website contains the complete materials for Harvard's 2022-2023 offering of CS290, the **Seminar on Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture**.
This seminar is **mandatory** for all entering Computer Science (CS) doctoral students.
Although the seminar was designed for CS doctoral students in mind, we believe these materials can be useful to the **broader community**.
To learn more about our approach to the course, please also refer to:
* The **student-facing** 2022-2023 [course website](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290) (the 2021-2022 course website can be found [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-2021-2022/))
* Our paper about the course describing our **design philosophy, learning objective and evaluation** of the course: [Empowering First-Year Computer Science Ph.D. Students to Create a Culture that Values Community and Mental Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12650).

If you do use our materials, please do reference our [student-facing course website](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290) / these teaching materials, as well as [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12650):

**Course Developers:**
* [Yaniv Yacoby](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/)
* [Eura Shin](https://eurashin.github.io/)
* [John Girash](https://scholar.harvard.edu/girash/home)
* [David C. Parkes](https://parkes.seas.harvard.edu/)

In addition to the main course developers listed above, we've had individual sessions contributed by a number of scholars, especially in the spring semester. Without them, this offering of the course would not be possible.

**Class Structure:**
The course meets once a week for 120min during the fall and spring semesters.
Classes generally followed this structure:
1. Students are given time to socialize
2. A brief recap of takeaways last week's session (whole-class discussion)
3. A brief presentation motivating today's topic
4. Alternating small-group exercises with whole-class discussion
5. A brief survey on today's session
6. Some time at the end for socializing
