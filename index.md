title: The 2022-2023 Teaching Materials for CS290
---


> **Note:** This website currently only contains the materials for the fall 2022 offering of the seminar. We will update it with the spring materials by the summer of 2023. While the fall semester primarely focused on skill-building, the spring semester will focus more on:
* Mental health in academia
* Diversity and leadership in tech
* Power dynamics in scientific communities and research in context

This website contains the complete materials for Harvard's 2022-2023 offering of CS290, the **Seminar on Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture**.
This seminar is **mandatory** for all entering Computer Science (CS) doctoral students.
Although the seminar was designed for CS doctoral students in mind, we believe these materials can be useful to the **broader community**.
To learn more about our approach to the course, please also refer to:
* The **student-facing** 2022-2023 [course website](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290) (the 2021-2022 course website can be found [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-2021-2022/))
* Our paper about the course describing our **design philosophy, learning objective and evaluation** of the course: [Empowering First-Year Computer Science Ph.D. Students to Create a Culture that Values Community and Mental Health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12650).

**Class Structure:**
The course meets once a week for 120min during the fall and spring semesters.
Classes generally followed this structure:
1. Students are given time to socialize
2. A brief recap of takeaways last week's session (whole-class discussion)
3. A brief presentation motivating today's topic
4. Alternating small-group exercises with whole-class discussion
5. A brief survey on today's session
6. Some time at the end for socializing
